## Detail notes:

### Background knowledge of the company & what they are doing:
- A machine goes into the water pipeline for inspection.
- The machine has 6 cameras (pics of the inside of the pipe), piecing all 6 pics, you get a 360 view of the inside. Or just 1 front camera
- The machine flows with the water in the pipe so all the areas in the pipeline be taken pictures/recorded.
- Inspection for any abnormality such as leaves, plastic bags, connection cracks between pipeline that would result in leakage, fish, etc.
- Inspection also for places to check such as man whole,
- Info about water pipelines not on the official website since this part is still in production, and only in oil pipeline on the website
- Looking for a web-app that will integrate with their current workflow that will facilitate.
