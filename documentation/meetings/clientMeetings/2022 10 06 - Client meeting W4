Meeting time: Oct. 7th at 10am-11am

Meeting location: Online

Attendees: Rosen: Matthias; Team B: All members attended

Note Taker: Lydia, Ali

Summary of the meeting:
—

Team C Q&A:

- User specificed: Video or Picture that they want to see
- DB: Can store photo or video
- [ ]  question: how do we know a video contains a fish, and the length of the video? We need to know the output from the algo
- The client expects the web app to be running locally, so that they can access it, and so the user will not swap to new devices, no need for cloud storage?
- [ ]  question: where’re the pics & video at current?
- Currently, the data is stored on a server network, and the data scientist is allowed to store info on the server (the user has already has privileges ) , BUT rosen won’t give us the access. They want us to start database or our own file system, and they will start with this system that we provide afterward)
- The VGG16 will be the algorithm we use?
    - Linked List? Each node is an image? Still confusing?
- Perform AL timing testing to check efficiency of AL algorithm
- Optionally, they want us to use a blender file to render a video, and then we should add additional functionality to the file, more fishes, more surfaces etc.
    - Making a function/button that automated the generation of the pipeline
    - Could help with data generation for training the algorithm
- The web server has  the same access rights as the server
- Further evolve the website, by using python
- Client will not provide a cloud-based server to host web-app, making this slightly more confusing
    - Recommended using the server access on their local machines, to access the photos/videos that Rosen has
- Internally they use Flake8, and Black
- They use vgg16, provides turns images into vectors, won't do active learning, and so we need to find the actual algorithm.

---

- Each pic, a vector
- in the blender file (we will get it later), we will get the assets (pics or vectors). we need to create Scripts, and use the blender API.

- (optional) count times before the algo is train completely that no fish in each run
- tech stack:
    - local repo, no could

Team B:

- Integrated to network, not website
- Network is access thro file exporler
- Code convention:
- Different framework for each team is okay
- frameworks are okay to use

aesthetic: no guideline (each app interal looks different)

rosen colors will be provided
