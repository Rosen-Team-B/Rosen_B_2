# 2022/10/11 - Client Meeting W5

Created: October 11, 2022

- Currently, there is no difference between admin users and normal users
    - We already know that there will be a difference between them in the future, so keep in mind that different privileges might occur.
    - Different actions for different roles.

- Performance
    - Execution time should be low, no fixed time for this, keep in mind that this interactive
        - Take a baseline reading, how much time does it take to filter through by hand
    - Accuracy of the learning algorithm, how good, how many iterations do we need to find all instances of the objects

- The sample image is the only format that the user is expected to submit (only that).
- Maybe it’s sufficient enough to store the label and the video path/name.
- Two different labels can be assigned to the same video.
- Django, ReactJS will be used

- Database is allowed for the project, and we can use anyone that fits within our tech stack.
- The other option for not using Blender is actually get access to database
    - Concern with how real-life videos and blender rendering might cause the algorithm to not work efficiently.
    - However, Blender is easier to work with because there are already labels that we can use.
    - Further development will use Blender.
- The user is NOT uploading a vector of photos , but the image that they submit will use vgg16 to get the vector of the image. VERY IMPORTANT.
- Output should be:
    - List of matches of object, and also
    - Give timestamp of each object where it was found, of the video.
- Client doesn’t seem keen with waiting off for the AL algorithm, because he wants both to developed in tandem.
- Do not train VGG16, and just use it and apply it
    - No need for blender images? We need to check this
- We need to find an Active Learning algorithm, and we don’t use it on pre-trained data, the training will occur in house, using blender
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Psychit Learn?

---

- Input:
    - labeling: fish vs !fish (classA vs classB)
- Output: timestamp of the video

Pre-trained vgg16:

- do not train this network (just download and use it)
- don’t need blender imgs for this to train

Active learning algorithm: 

- Recommended svm- package in python
- To be trained while users are using
- This is for a smaller scale labels or image..?
- Few labels
- Train from scratch
- Do we have a based model/?
- Don’t have to optimize it, but we do have to have this too.
