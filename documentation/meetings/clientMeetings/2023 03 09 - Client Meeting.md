Feedback from client:

- user should be able to chose how many images to be shown in step 5 (hard optional)
- Image display in step 5 must show the time frame of the video (example: 00:01:15)
- Client asks us (stats for the performance, not top priority, but nice to give him) â†’ put in document will be good too
    - How long is each step
    - Are the imgs different each run or if the video is longer
    - 20 mins video, every 1000 frame. Do the same vedio for all 3 rosen team to see the performance stat (do this discusses with other teams next thursday when client is on a vaca)
