Feedback:

- Ali did well in taking control and responsibility for questions
- Communication between the project manager and liaison could be improved
- Not enough work with DevOps and QA for problems or notes to be made
- Communication overall has improved since last week but still needs improvement (falling behind compared to other teams)
- Going forward in client meetings, clear explanations on questions should be laid out before asking
- Liaison should update on communication in comparison to other teams
- Find a solution for detailing questions mid-meeting (between Liaison and project manager)

Client Meeting:

- The database will point to local system
- Find a way to collaborate/merge a database for our specific team data
- Database will take in Vectors
- Currently only one type of user (data scientist)
- Backend must support account privileges for added roles
- Asked performance was ambiguous and was suggested to take a baseline reading
- Wait time will be at our group’s discretion
- Group isn’t responsible for refining algorithm
- User will only submit an image
- Try to add video support for web app functionality
- Labels can be assigned to an image (labels will be associated with objects in image and will help algorithm)
- Other teams may have further research on which algorithms to use and options
- Dockers and containers are allowed (just as long as it runs on a local machine)
- Data will either be provided by ROSEN (unlikely) or use Blender to create our own dataset
- Blender assets have been sent via Microsoft Teams and need to be experimented with (Jeena?)
- Wants timestamp for when object occurs in the video
- Expected simultaneous development of web app and algorithm implementation
- Team weekly meeting is good but further meetings for teamwork (coding) need to be scheduled
- Inquire further on the client’s request for simultaneous development for algorithm and web app
- Ask the client if they can render while we can write the scripts (the team’s devices won’t be strong enough to fully render the requested files)
- Jeena can research into rendering for blender

Database to use:

- MySQL
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon S3
- TASK: Research into potential databases to use that are efficient for images and is free
