# 2022/10/13 - Team meeting W5

Created: October 13, 2022

Feedback:

- Ali did well in taking control and responsibility for questions
- Communication between the project manager and liaison could be improved
- Not enough work with DevOps and QA for problems or notes to be made
- Communication overall has improved since last week but still needs improvement (falling behind compared to other teams)
- Going forward in client meetings, clear explanations on questions should be laid out before asking
- Liaison should update on communication in comparison to other teams
- Find a solution for detailing questions mid-meeting (between Liaison and project manager)
