L brief descp. of project

for Rosen the company they will take inspection, they will put the videos in the local database, videos will turn into images

after putting in the database

our job is to help the data scientists

what they do is they want to identify fish in the inspection they upload image of the fish upload it to our system

once the data scientist uploads the image, it goes to backend, algo will vectorize it

data base includes images

it will query 10 images from db

10 images most likely to be fish display it to frontend

data scientist goes over each image and selects the fishes

by doing that labels the images

sends them back
