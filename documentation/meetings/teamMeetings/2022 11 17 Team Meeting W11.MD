Need to research on vector databases for querying because we have very large datasets to work with
Probable: use Milvus vector database

## Transcript

A: CM was in person, 3 people showed up which ðŸ˜•

but its okay b and J didnt show up

we just discussed what we did

just mentioned we finished docker

dcoker good to go

but frontend we have nothing

I mentioned that we were making componenents

why using components is better

he just asked what your progress is

just progress feed back

Point 1:

he wants to present something from ROSEN

I want all of us to show

have to showup for 10-15 mins

1:30 on tuesday

B: I can be there

J: I can't be there

A: its okay youre busy

Point 2

related to database and holding all the images after talking with lysdia and luca

worst case scenario

24 hour video is very long

calculated frames,

2 million for every 24 hours

the more time we use harder it gets

discussion regarding that

the links you saw are related to databases and backend implementations

regards of querying

something to keep in mind

20 million images

ML point of view

vectorizing images

each image is set in dimensions

upto 2nd last layer, images will be vectorized

for every image in 2 mil

reduces accuracy

in terms of runtime its bad

it will not be efficient

so thatâ€™s why

thatâ€™s mainly it

any questions

B: the max?

A: worst case scenario is 24 hour

B: no way of getting around

A : L said that it is possible to ask them to cut the videos into smaller portions

we were asking to check in backend

vectorize takes too much time

building from scartch

we shouyld gofrom easy to hard

B: my second solution is if we have time

we can parse the video itself

completely out of the scope

it will divide itself

easier way is to set a limit on the length of the video

L:

notify them, give a warning

function to detect

this is all provided we even have time

we will jot it down for later

find a way

B: theres non ay around that

L: there is, it will take a long time

J: SKIP frames

A: another algo detection thing, its hard

idk how long it will take

when we finish, when it can actually run

we will
